## How to apply the Terraform resources to your Grafana Cloud stack

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node (>= 22.x)
- Terraform (>= 1.3.0)
- A Grafana Cloud account with an existing stack

After cloning the repository create a .env file based on the .env.example file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit the .env file and add a Grafana Cloud API Key and the details of your stack.
```
STACK_SLUG=mystack
CLOUD_REGION=prod-eu-west-2
CLOUD_ACCESS_POLICY_TOKEN=abdc123
```

That's it! Now run the following command to create the resources in your Grafana Cloud Stack.

```
make tf-bootstrap
```

Once you are done, you can check your Grafana Cloud stack to see the new resources.

If you want to clean up and remove all the resources created, just run:
```
make tf-destroy
```

**Where to find the Stack Slug and Cloud Region?**   
1. Log in to your Grafana Cloud account.
2. Select your organization from the organization drop-down menu.
3. In the Stacks section, click Details next to the stack you want to use.
4. Copy the Slug and the Region.

**How do I create a Grafana Cloud API key?**   
With a [Grafana Cloud Access Policy](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/security-and-account-management/authentication-and-permissions/access-policies/). Make sure that you configure the minimun required scopes:  
- stacks:read   
- stacks:write   
- subscriptions:read   
- orgs:read   
- stack-service-accounts:write   	

## How to regenerate the client after updating the OpenAPI spec

Just run:

```
make gen-openapi-client
```

## Working with k6 Studio

This repo includes reusable artifacts for [k6 Studio](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/k6-studio/).

You can sync them between your local Studio installation and this repository using:
```bash
# Copy artifacts from the repo to your local Studio install
make studio-update-local

# Copy artifacts from your local Studio install to the repo
make studio-update-repo
```

> These sync commands are non-destructive. They only add or update files.
